This is a patched version of the argtable library version 3
===========================================================

The patch removes the NetBSD implementation of getopt that is shipped with
argtable3 by default under the 4-clause BSD license.

As a consequence :
- this patched version of argtable is compatible with the GPLv3 license;
- but it needs a implementation getopt to be available on your system to be able
  to run (this is the case on GNU Linux for instance).
